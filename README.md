# Persian Calendar Website

Welcome to the Persian Calendar Website! This site helps you see the current date and time in different calendar systems and lets you convert dates between them. It’s designed for Persian-speaking users, with text in Farsi and numbers in Persian style (like ۰-۹).

## What Does It Do?

- **Shows Today’s Date and Time**: Displays the current date, time, and day of the week in five calendar types:
  - **Persian (خورشیدی)**: The solar calendar used in Iran.
  - **Imperial (شاهنشاهی)**: An ancient Persian calendar, starting 559 BCE.
  - **Hijri (هجری قمری)**: The Islamic lunar calendar.
  - **Gregorian (میلادی)**: The common global calendar.
  - **Unix (تایم‌استمپ)**: A timestamp counting seconds since 1970.
- **Switch Calendars**: Click tabs to view the date in any calendar. The page updates instantly.
- **Convert Dates**: Enter a date (year, month, day) or timestamp, pick a calendar, and see it in all other calendars.
- **Check Time Difference**: After converting a date, see how far it is from today (e.g., “2 years, 3 months away”).
- **Looks Nice**: Features a colorful design with animations, a logo, and floating particles. Works great on phones too!
